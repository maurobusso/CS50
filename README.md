# CS50

I've created this repository to share my solutions to the assignments from Harvard University's 2023 CS50 intro course and to document my learning journey throughout the program. 
You can access the course materials [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) or refer to the assignment specifications linked on the right side of each section in the table of contents. 
I hope this repository proves helpful to fellow students. If you find it beneficial, kindly consider leaving a star!

Important point to keep in mind regarding Academic Honesty. While these solutions can assist you in navigating the course with less difficulty, 
I encourage you to make a sincere effort to devise your own working solutions before consulting mine. 
Investing time and effort into independently solving the problem sets, in my view, is the best way to truly learn from this course.
